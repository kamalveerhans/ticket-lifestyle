<p>
Karen (End User) is in the process of creating a ticket. She begins by completing the required fields requested by the support center. Next, she selects the Help Topic as 'Reporting a Problem' and provides a brief issue summary, stating that the 'entire mobile/online banking system is down.' After filling out these essential details, Karen includes a concise but thorough description of the situation affecting her employees.

<p>Next, John, a Help Desk Agent, will log into his account to review the ticket's details. Agents can view active tickets within the agent panel. Managers have the ability to assign high-priority tickets to the appropriate agents and apply SLAs (Service Level Agreements)</p>

<p>After John selects the ticket, he can access all relevant information, including the SLA, status, priority, and additional details. John notices he lacks the necessary permissions to modify the ticket, the ticket is reassigned to another help desk agent named Jane. Jane assigns the SLA plan to Sev-A (Severity 1), the highest priority level. This indicates the issue is critical, requiring an initial response within 1 hour, updates every 4 hours, and resolution or downgrade within 24 hours</p>

<p>As Jane works on resolving the issue, she posts an update to inform everyone of her thoughts on the situation and the steps sheâ€™s taking to address it.</p>

<p>Jane's initial assessment of the issue turned out to be correct. During the process of resolving it, she escalated the ticket's priority to 'Emergency,' as the problem had the potential to impact the entire business</p>
